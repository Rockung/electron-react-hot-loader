## Electron-react integration

It's hard to setup a project for `electron/react/webpack/hot-loader` because of the firewall in the mainland. I refined the code from [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate). It works only by using cnpm tools like this.

* cnpm install
* cnpm run dev
